### Introduction 
A small console application that reads png files and compresses them into a jpeg file format. Tools like this exist, but this is built for helping compress large files that I use for my Church's Narthex slideshow.
I eventually would like to make a simple UI using MAUI or WPF. 

### Dependencies
.NET 8 is a dependency for this project
